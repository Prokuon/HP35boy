## Install on your Arduboy
Check http://arduboy.ried.cl 

## Credits

The whole emulator was written by http://home.citycable.ch/pierrefleur/Jacques-Laporte/HP35_Arduino.htm, this is merely an adaptation for the Arduboy form factor. Please check `rom.h` credits for the original license text

## ROM with bug

To use an alternative version of the ROM with the `exp(ln(2.02))=2` bug, hold button B when booting. http://www.jacques-laporte.org/HP3520bug.htm



## Changes

In this fork, I redrew the theme and rotated the orientation to fit using the right hand control buttons
